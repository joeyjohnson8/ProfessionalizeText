Often, professionals would like to improve the quality of their emails, but don't have the \
            skills to do so - I created a tool to help with this problem. Simply input the gist of your \
            email and select your preferred style from the dropdown menus, and an enhanced, professional \
            version of your email will be outputted. Built by Joey Johnson using OpenAI, Langchain and Streamlit.
